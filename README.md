# PacMan

## Description

An MIT educational program to move an animated 'PacMan' image horizontally, with edge detection and direction changing.

## Installation

Download all repository files and store them in the same folder.

## Usage

Load starter01.html in a web browser, and click on the 'PacMan' image to begin executing the movement code. Clicking the image multiple times will result in multiple executions of the code, each on independent timers. This allows for faster movement. To experiment with my "bouncing" code during edge detection, use the browser console or edit the html file directly to increase the value of the variable 'speed'.

## Roadmap

- Refactor code to reduce redundancy
- Edit comments to fit better on narrow displays
- Clean up if statements
- Clean up math for right side "bounce"
- Add check to onClick to prevent multiple executions by continued clicking beyond the first
